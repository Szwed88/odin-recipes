    <p>This effortless rustic bread recipe is the simplest bread recipe
         I've ever found and luckily, it's also incredibly delicious! 
         You can halve the recipe for just one loaf, but be warned; 
         it's so tasty you'll wish you'd baked two!

    Mix water, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl.

    Stir flour into yeast mixture until well combined.

<li>
    Shape dough into 2 loaves using damp hands.
    Place loaves on a cornmeal-dusted work surface; score tops a few
    times with a sharp knife. Transfer to a baking sheet until loaves
    to double in size, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>      
<li>
    Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>      
<li>
    Bake loaves in the preheated oven,
    spraying surface of dough occasionally with water, until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
