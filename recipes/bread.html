    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        This effortless rustic bread recipe is the simplest bread recipe
         I've ever found and luckily, it's also incredibly delicious! 
         You can halve the recipe for just one loaf, but be warned; 
         it's so tasty you'll wish you'd baked two!
    </p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
            <li>3 cups warm water</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons coarse salt</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
 
<ol>
<li>
    <p>Mix water, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl.</p>
     Let stand until mixture becomes foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
     <li>
        <p>Stir flour into yeast mixture until well combined.
         Dough will be shaggy and look wet. Cover bowl loosely with a damp towel;
          let sit in a warm place, about 5 hours.</p></li>
         <p></p>   
     <li>
        <p>Shape dough into 2 loaves using damp hands.
         Place loaves on a cornmeal-dusted work surface; score tops a few
          times with a sharp knife. Transfer to a baking sheet until loaves
             to double in size, 30 to 60 minutes.</p></li>
        <p></p>
     <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</p></li>
        <p></p>
     <li>
        <p>Bake loaves in the preheated oven,
         spraying surface of dough occasionally with water, until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</p></li> 
         <p></p>
